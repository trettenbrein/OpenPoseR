# OpenPoseR
An [R](https://www.r-project.org) package that provides some functions for analyzing motion-tracking data derived from video files using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose).

The original motivation for creating this package was to control video stimuli in sign language and gesture reserach, but the provided functionality may also be useful for other purposes.
