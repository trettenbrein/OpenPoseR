# OpenPoseR
An [R](https://www.r-project.org) package that provides some functions for analyzing motion-tracking data derived from video files using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose).

The original motivation for creating this package was to control video stimuli in sign language and gesture reserach, but the provided functionality may also be useful for other purposes.

## Installation  

For now, OpenPoseR can be installed using the following commands (you will need to have the ``devtools`` package installed):

```r
# Install devtools from CRAN (if not already installed)
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("trettenbrein/OpenPoseR")
```
